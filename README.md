In this course, I learned about and continued to use the singleton method.
I implemented the REST API effectively. The client wanted to create a game on various platforms. The game “Draw it or lose it” consists of multiple players on different teams competing to figure out the drawn card, if the team is unable to guess correctly. The opposing team has a chance to counter.
I was tasked to figure out which platform, server, storage options would suit my client’s needs the best.
I compared different operating systems, servers, serverless, storage options, whether physical or cloud storage, and suggested that the Windows operating system and cloud storage are my suggestions.
The course made me self-aware that analyzing the hardware is critical. It should be one of the first things to inspect before coding. As programs become more intricate and complex, The computing machine needs to be capable of handling the complexity of the code.
